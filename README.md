# 127.0.0.1::Aman Khandelwal  
_(caffeine-powered keyboard smasher)_

CS undergrad @ PES University, Bangalore  

- Building stuff that occasionally works on the first try  
- Obsessed with AI, networks, and wondering why `sudo` won’t fix my life  
- 50% debugging, 50% pretending I understand Docker  
- Half developer, half caffeine molecule  

**Current Status:**  
- ✅ Writing code  
- ❌ Understanding how `git rebase` works  
- ❌ Having a sleep schedule  

_"If my code runs, it’s a feature. If it crashes, it’s a learning experience."_
